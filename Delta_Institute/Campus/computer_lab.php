                <p>Modern Computer Labs with computers of latest configuration and peripherals are established at the
                    Campus for the students and other academia. The total computer density, considering computers
                    provided in all the labs of Campus, is 1000+ computers. The campus has always been leader in
                    employing new – generation computers for the use of students. When Computers with Hyper threading
                    processors from Intel were introduced, MEFGI was the first Campus to have installation of 75
                    Computers on a one go. Recently, when Computers with Duel Core Processors from Intel are introduced,
                    again the MEFGI has taken lead in deploying the same for the students.
                    The other unique feature of Computer usage has been use of branded PCs from leading global brands.
                    IBM, DELL and HP machines are provided in the labs to expose the students to different brands and
                    technology.</p>

                <p>The Campus is currently having Internet connectivity of 250 MBPS bandwidth through Fibre Optic
                    Cable. A wireless RF link is also established as a standby. The Internet facilities are made
                    available to staff and students for 24 hrs round the year.
                    All the computers at the Campus are networked through Star topology configuration. Two IBM servers
                    with dual Xeon processors have been employed for networking. One of the servers is used for central
                    data storage. It also supports Internet facilities for internal E- communication and the other is
                    used as main server.</p>
